      Because every building is different, there is no standard seismic
      restraint solution to address site, location, form and function. The scope
      of seismic restraint and related engineering work that will be required
      will not be known until the ceiling design is completed. The T&amp;R
      Seismic System will provide a solution for buildings with an Importance
      Level of 3 and below. A suitably qualified Chartered Professional Engineer
      will be required for Importance Levels 4 &amp; 5. It is imperative that
      mechanical services, sprinkler systems, electrical and suspended ceiling
      design are all co-ordinated at appropriate stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      While full compliance with seismic requirements will add cost, it will
      limit damage, reduce repair costs and reduce the time to re-occupy post
      event. Furthermore it is now a legislative requirement for Code of
      Compliance Certificates and Health and Safety Laws. The new laws, affect
      those who are upstream from the workplace (for example designers,
      engineers, manufacturers, suppliers or installers). Specifically they have
      a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the work they
      do or the things they provide to the workplace don't create health and
      safety risks.

        suspended ceilings. The calculations are based on conservative
        assumptions. Reduced seismic bracing designs for individual sites may be
        possible if a suitably qualified Chartered Professional Engineer carries
        out a site-specific design. This guide should not be used as a
        calculation template for a PS-1; specific seismic design should be
        carried out for these cases.</i

    <h3>Introduction to suspended ceiling seismic design</h3>
    <p>
      There are two main ways of approaching the seismic design of a suspended
      ceiling, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Perimeter Fixing</h4>
    <p>
      This approach to seismic restraint relies on connections to adjacent walls
      to transfer the horizontal seismic load back to the primary building
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perimeter fixing approach relies on a fix-float philosophy, where the
      perimeter edges directly opposite a 'fixed' edge shall be 'floating'.
    </p>

          alt="Fixed edge Configuration2"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      A fixed edge has the tee riveted to the wall trim and screws each side of
      the tee into the wall to provide a solid load path. The floating edge has
      seismic clearance between the ceiling and the wall to allow for movement
      of the building structure.
    </p>

          alt="Fixed floating edge"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h5><b>Pros:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheaper and faster installation</li>
      <li>Less plenum congestion</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>Cons:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can only be used for small-medium ceilings, as the ceiling size is
        limited by the grid strength
      </li>
      <li>Walls must be capable of transferring the seismic load</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Seismic joints may be used to expand the size of ceiling that may be edge
      restrained. A seismic joint essentially creates a 'floating' edge in the
      ceiling, allowing opposing ceiling edges to be fixed.

      />
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>2. Back Bracing</h4>
    <p>
      This approach is used for larger ceilings, where the required ceiling tee
      lengths exceed the allowable lengths or where the walls around the ceiling
      cannot be relied upon to transfer the seismic load to the primary building
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rigid bracing is used evenly throughout the ceiling to transfer the
      ceiling seismic load through to the overhead structure. This approach
      requires that all the perimeter edges are floating in order to prevent
      damage from inter-story drift.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="/uploads/images/floating1.jpg"
          alt="Typical Fixed edge"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="/uploads/images/floating2.jpg"
          alt="Fixed floating edge"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h5><b>Pros</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Suitable for large ceilings</li>
      <li>
        No load from the ceiling is transferred to perimeter walls. This is
        important if there are part height walls or bulkheads around the ceiling
        that have not been designed to carry the ceiling loads.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>Cons</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Larger plenum heights require large floating edge clearances</li>
      <li>Usually more expensive than edge-restrained designs</li>
      <li>Harder to keep ceiling square as there are no fixed edges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An alternative to back bracing that may be used in certain situations is
      rigid hangers. This approach is suitable for ceilings suspended very close
      (50-500mm) to purlins, rafters/trusses, or floor joists. The wire hangers
      are replaced with heavy gauge steel angle hangers, which are used to
      transfer the seismic load back to primary structure.

    <h4>Step One - Limit State Type</h4>

    <h5><b>What is limit state design?</b></h5>
    <p>
      The limit state of a ceiling determines the level of seismic activity that
      the ceiling must withstand. A structure shall be designed and constructed
      in such a way that it will, during its design working life (with
      appropriate degrees of reliability) sustain all seismic activity that is
      likely to occur.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Serviceability Limit State One (SLS1)</b></h5>
    <p>
      No damage occurs and the structure and the non-structural components do
      not require repair after the seismic event.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Serviceability Limit State Two (SLS2)</b></h5>
    <p>
      The system is should only suffer minor damage and should be able to be
      repaired within a short period of time. Ceilings designed to SLS2 may have
      lightweight tiles, sections of grid, and other components fall during
      larger earthquakes. Therefore designing a ceiling to SLS2 loads is a risk
      based decision and project stakeholders should be made aware.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Ultimate Limit State (ULS)</b></h5>
    <p>
      Specifically, for earthquake actions this shall mean avoidance of collapse
      of the structural system or parts of the structure representing a hazard
      to human life inside and outside the structure necessary for the building
      evacuation.
    </p>

    <p>
      ULS requirements must be met for all ceilings, but there are multiple
      pathways to achieve this. ULS design criteria can be met by either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designing the ceiling to withstand higher ULS loads. Note that damage to
        the ceiling is still likely to occur during a ULS event, independently
        tethering heavy items that could be a life safety hazard is advised.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design the ceiling to withstand SLS2 loads. There must be
        <b><u>no</u></b> parts in the ceiling that may be a life safety risk if
        the ceiling was to collapse, therefore meeting ULS requirements by
        ensuring there are no life safety hazards present. Designing to SLS2
        only is a risk based decision that should be made by suitably competent
        engineer and discussed with the client and end user. It is not suitable
        for all projects.

                <p>
                  The ductility of a ceiling relates to the capability of the
                  ceiling and it's connections to absorb and dissipate energy
                  during an earthquake without failure. A higher ductility
                  allows for a greater ability to absorb earthquake energy, and
                  therefore results in larger limiting lengths. Using a
                  ductility of 1.0 is the more conservative approach. Several NZ
                  standards give guidance on what ductility to use for
                  design:<br />
                  <b>NZS2785:2020</b>, Suspended ceilings - Design and
                  installation. - This standard gives a maximum ductility of 1.0
                  for ultimate limit state.<br />
                  <b>NZS4600:2018</b>, Cold-formed steel structures. - This
                  standard gives a maximum ductility of 1.25 for ultimate limit
                  state. Both standards are referenced by B1 of the NZ building
                  code (NZS2785 is indirectly referenced), in general the most
                  current standard should be used.

    <h4>Step Four - Calculating the Grid Capacity</h4>
    <p>
      This section calculates the limiting tee length using the seismic force
      and the capacity of the grid tees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physical testing and calculations have given a capacity of the main and
      cross tees per metre. These limiting tee lengths will be used for both
      fixed two float two perimeter fixing and back bracing suspended ceiling
      seismic restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following steps calculate the maximum allowable tee lengths based on
      the capacity of the tees. Firstly, select the type of trim used, type of
      connection and the the corresponding capacity of the structural limit
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rivets are to be 3.2mm steel rivets or 3.2mm grade 5056 aluminum rivets.

    <h4>Step Five - Calculating Rigid Hanger suitability</h4>

    <p>
      This section calculates if rigid hangers are suitable for providing dead
      load, live load and seismic restraint of the ceiling.
    </p>

    <p>Rigid Hangers are suitable in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low plenum height (less than 600mm)</li>
      <li>Purlins or timber joists above</li>
      <li>Edge restraining the ceiling is not suitable</li>
    </ul>
    Rigid Hangers cannot be used if:
    <ul>
      <li>The plenum height is larger than 600mm)</li>
      <li>
        Concrete slab is above (back bracing is more suitable in this situation)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      If rigid hangers are used, the suspended ceiling should have floating
      edges on all edges.

    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Height of connection to structure</h4>
    <p>
      This is the maximum height of the rigid hanger connection to structure.
      Measure from the connection to overhead structure to the ground level.
    </p>
    <table class="table">

        <tr>
          <td>Connection Height (m)</td>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Maximum Plenum Height</h4>
    <p>
      Specify the maximum plenum height so the seismic moment per hanger can be
      determined. <b>This needs to be less than 600mm.</b>
    </p>
    <table class="table">

    <h4>Seismic Moment</h4>
    <p>
      The maximum allowable plenum height for rigid hanger ceilings is 600mmm.
      The seismic moment per hanger is then equal to the seismic load multiplied
      by the hanger spacing and the plenum height. Repeat this separately for
      ULS, SLS1 and SLS2 seismic forces.

        Braces should be set out in a "grid" pattern, the area supported by each
        brace must not exceed the area per brace calculated below.
      </li>
      <li>
        The distance between the first line of bracing and the perimeter walls
        should not exceed half the brace spacing.
      </li>
      <li>Position braces at grid connections between main and cross tees.</li>
      <li>
        Typically, there should be at least 4 braces per ceiling, however 2
        braces can be used if the ceiling is very small.

    <h4>Step Eight - Back Bracing Seismic Clearance</h4>
    <p>
      Determining a seismic clearance is to ensure there is sufficient clearance
      to allow parts to move relative to each other during a seismic event.
    </p>

    <table class="table">
      <thead>

          <td><span class="pheighttxt" id="pheighttxt1"></span></td>
          <td>X</td>

          <td><span id="clearance2"></span></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Round the required seismic clearance up to the nearest 5mm and ensure that
      this clearance is used on the floating edges required in the back braced
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      For larger plenum heights the required seismic clearance may be
      impractical, for site specific installations contact a suitably qualified
      consulting engineer.
