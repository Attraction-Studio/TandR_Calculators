          T&R Seismic Calculator - Suspended Plasterboard Grid System

        <p class="paragraph-18px max-w-3xl">
          This calculator helps you determine seismic requirements for suspended
          plasterboard grid ceiling systems in accordance with NZ seismic
          standards.

        Because every building is different, there is no standard seismic
        restraint solution to address site, location, form and function. The
        scope of seismic restraint and related engineering work that will be
        required will not be known until the ceiling design is completed. The
        T&R Seismic System will provide a solution for buildings with an
        Importance Level of 3 and below. A suitably qualified Chartered
        Professional Engineer will be required for Importance Levels 4 & 5. It
        is imperative that mechanical services, sprinkler systems, electrical
        and suspended ceiling design are all co-ordinated at appropriate stages.

        While full compliance with seismic requirements will add cost, it will
        limit damage, reduce repair costs and reduce the time to re-occupy post
        event. Furthermore it is now a legislative requirement for Code of
        Compliance Certificates and Health and Safety Laws. The new laws, affect
        those who are upstream from the workplace (for example designers,
        engineers, manufacturers, suppliers or installers). Specifically they
        have a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the
        work they do or the things they provide to the workplace don't create
        health and safety risks.

          This seismic design guide is provided to determine the installation
          requirements and details for the ceiling system. The calculations are
          based on conservative assumptions. Reduced seismic bracing for
          individual sites may be possibly if a suitably qualified engineer
          carries out a site specific design.

          This guide has been prepared by JSK Consulting Engineers for T&R
          Interior Systems with the usual care and thoroughness of the
          consulting profession. On the basis of the assumptions and limitations
          presented in the guide, application of the guide is up to the users
          discretion and outside the control of JSK Consulting Engineers.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm mb-4 italic">
          If the building is outside the assumptions and limitations detailed
          then a suitable site specific seismic design should be performed by a
          qualified Chartered Professional Engineer. This guide should not be
          used as a calculation template for a PS1; site specific design should
          be carried out for these cases also.

        <p class="text-sm mb-4 italic">
          Allowance for relative motion between the ceiling and structure must
          be provided by floating edges. If the perimeter bracing method is used
          then two perpendicular edges must be fixed with the remaining two
          floating. If back bracing to the upper structure is used, then all
          edges must be floating. Floating edges must also be provided around
          rigid or separately braced items that pass through the ceiling. The
          amount of clearance should be checked by an engineer on a case-by-case
          basis.
