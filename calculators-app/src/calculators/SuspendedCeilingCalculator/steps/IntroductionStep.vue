          This calculator helps you determine seismic requirements for suspended
          ceiling systems in accordance with NZ seismic standards.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Because every building is different, there is no standard seismic
        restraint solution to address site, location, form and function. The
        scope of seismic restraint and related engineering work that will be
        required will not be known until the ceiling design is completed. The
        T&R Seismic System will provide a solution for buildings with an
        Importance Level of 3 and below. A suitably qualified Chartered
        Professional Engineer will be required for Importance Levels 4 & 5. It
        is imperative that mechanical services, sprinkler systems, electrical
        and suspended ceiling design are all co-ordinated at appropriate stages.

        While full compliance with seismic requirements will add cost, it will
        limit damage, reduce repair costs and reduce the time to re-occupy post
        event. Furthermore it is now a legislative requirement for Code of
        Compliance Certificates and Health and Safety Laws. The new laws, affect
        those who are upstream from the workplace (for example designers,
        engineers, manufacturers, suppliers or installers). Specifically they
        have a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the
        work they do or the things they provide to the workplace don't create
        health and safety risks.

        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          This guide allows a designer to calculate required bracing for
          suspended ceilings. The calculations are based on conservative
          assumptions. Reduced seismic bracing designs for individual sites may
          be possible if a suitably qualified Chartered Professional Engineer
          carries out a site-specific design. This guide should not be used as a
          calculation template for a PS-1; specific seismic design should be
          carried out for these cases.

          This guide has been prepared by JSK Consulting Engineers for T&R
          Interior Systems with the usual care and thoroughness of the
          consulting profession. Interpretation and application of this guide is
          outside the control of the engineer and therefore is the users'
          responsibility. This guide does not constitute a producer statement or
          engineer's certification, and is not for use with trafficable ceilings
          or ceilings which support partition walls or any other service load.

        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          Allowance for relative motion between the ceiling and structure must
          be provided by floating edges. If the perimeter bracing method is used
          then two perpendicular edges must be fixed with the remaining two
          floating. If back bracing to the upper structure is used, then all
          edges must be floating. Floating edges must also be provided around
          rigid or separately braced items that pass through the ceiling. The
          amount of clearance should be checked by an engineer on a case-by-case
          basis.
