# Step One - Limit State Type

## What is limit state design?

The limit state of a ceiling determines the level of seismic activity that the ceiling must withstand. A structure shall be designed and constructed in such a way that it will, during its design working life (with appropriate degrees of reliability) sustain all seismic activity that is likely to occur.

## Serviceability Limit State One (SLS1)

No damage occurs and the structure and the non-structural components do not require repair after the seismic event.

## Serviceability Limit State Two (SLS2)

The system is should only suffer minor damage and should be able to be repaired within a short period of time. Ceilings designed to SLS2 may have lightweight tiles, sections of grid, and other components fall during larger earthquakes. Therefore designing a ceiling to SLS2 loads is a risk based decision and project stakeholders should be made aware.

## Ultimate Limit State (ULS)

Specifically, for earthquake actions this shall mean avoidance of collapse of the structural system or parts of the structure representing a hazard to human life inside and outside the structure necessary for the building evacuation.

ULS requirements must be met for all ceilings, but there are multiple pathways to achieve this. ULS design criteria can be met by either:

- Designing the ceiling to withstand higher ULS loads. Note that damage to the ceiling is still likely to occur during a ULS event, independently tethering heavy items that could be a life safety hazard is advised.

- Design the ceiling to withstand SLS2 loads. There must be no parts in the ceiling that may be a life safety risk if the ceiling was to collapse, therefore meeting ULS requirements by ensuring there are no life safety hazards present. Designing to SLS2 only is a risk based decision that should be made by suitably competent engineer and discussed with the client and end user. It is not suitable for all projects.
  Determine the type of design for the installation.

Does any part of the suspended ceiling create a life safety hazard to building occupants?

Hazards include but are not limited to:

- Heavy/hard falling objects such as heavy acoustic tiles, lighting and heaters supported by the ceiling grid.
- Ceilings above emergency egress routes or emergency exits, where ceiling collapse could obstruct evacuation of the building.

As per the suppliment to NZS 1170.5, this category can apply to ceilings which interact with fire suppression systems, emergency lighting installations and other parts.

Note that this applies for all parts and components that are essential for a building to be occupied. These would include; fire protection systems, critical plumbing systems, electrical systems and lifts. For all structures these will be elements required to be returned to an operational state within an acceptably short time frame (hours or days rather than weeks) in order for the structure to be reoccupied.

For example reinstatement of lightweight fallen tiles may be considered a viable option within the time frame indicated to allow reoccupation of a office but may be unsuitable for an operating theatre.
