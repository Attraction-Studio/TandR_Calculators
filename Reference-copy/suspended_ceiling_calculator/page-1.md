# T&R Seismic Calculator

Because every building is different, there is no standard seismic restraint solution to address site, location, form and function. The scope of seismic restraint and related engineering work that will be required will not be known until the ceiling design is completed. The T&R Seismic System will provide a solution for buildings with an Importance Level of 3 and below. A suitably qualified Chartered Professional Engineer will be required for Importance Levels 4 & 5. It is imperative that mechanical services, sprinkler systems, electrical and suspended ceiling design are all co-ordinated at appropriate stages.

While full compliance with seismic requirements will add cost, it will limit damage, reduce repair costs and reduce the time to re-occupy post event. Furthermore it is now a legislative requirement for Code of Compliance Certificates and Health and Safety Laws. The new laws, affect those who are upstream from the workplace (for example designers, engineers, manufacturers, suppliers or installers). Specifically they have a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the work they do or the things they provide to the workplace don't create health and safety risks.

## Usage Notes:

This guide allows a designer to calculate required bracing for suspended ceilings. The calculations are based on conservative assumptions. Reduced seismic bracing designs for individual sites may be possible if a suitably qualified Chartered Professional Engineer carries out a site-specific design. This guide should not be used as a calculation template for a PS-1; specific seismic design should be carried out for these cases.

This guide has been prepared by JSK Consulting Engineers for T&R Interior Systems with the usual care and thoroughness of the consulting profession. Interpretation and application of this guide is outside the control of the engineer and therefore is the users' responsibility. This guide does not constitute a producer statement or engineer's certification, and is not for use with trafficable ceilings or ceilings which support partition walls or any other service load.

Allowance for relative motion between the ceiling and structure must be provided by floating edges. If the perimeter bracing method is used then two perpendicular edges must be fixed with the remaining two floating. If back bracing to the upper structure is used, then all edges must be floating. Floating edges must also be provided around rigid or separately braced items that pass through the ceiling. The amount of clearance should be checked by an engineer on a case-by-case basis.

Consult a structural engineer for the expected earthquake deflections of the structure.
