# Introduction to suspended ceiling seismic design

There are two main ways of approaching the seismic design of a suspended ceiling, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

1. Perimeter Fixing
   This approach to seismic restraint relies on connections to adjacent walls to transfer the horizontal seismic load back to the primary building structure.

The perimeter fixing approach relies on a fix-float philosophy, where the perimeter edges directly opposite a 'fixed' edge shall be 'floating'.

A fixed edge has the tee riveted to the wall trim and screws each side of the tee into the wall to provide a solid load path. The floating edge has seismic clearance between the ceiling and the wall to allow for movement of the building structure.

###Pros - Cheaper and faster installation - Less plenum congestion
###Cons - Can only be used for small-medium ceilings, as the ceiling size is limited by the grid strength - Walls must be capable of transferring the seismic load - Seismic joints may be used to expand the size of ceiling that may be edge restrained. A seismic joint essentially creates a 'floating' edge in the ceiling, allowing opposing ceiling edges to be fixed.

2. Back Bracing
   This approach is used for larger ceilings, where the required ceiling tee lengths exceed the allowable lengths or where the walls around the ceiling cannot be relied upon to transfer the seismic load to the primary building structure.

Rigid bracing is used evenly throughout the ceiling to transfer the ceiling seismic load through to the overhead structure. This approach requires that all the perimeter edges are floating in order to prevent damage from inter-story drift.

###Pros - Suitable for large ceilings - No load from the ceiling is transferred to perimeter walls. This is important if there are part height walls or bulkheads around the ceiling that have not been designed to carry the ceiling loads.
###Cons - Larger plenum heights require large floating edge clearances - Usually more expensive than edge-restrained designs - Harder to keep ceiling square as there are no fixed edges

An alternative to back bracing that may be used in certain situations is rigid hangers. This approach is suitable for ceilings suspended very close (50-500mm) to purlins, rafters/trusses, or floor joists. The wire hangers are replaced with heavy gauge steel angle hangers, which are used to transfer the seismic load back to primary structure.
